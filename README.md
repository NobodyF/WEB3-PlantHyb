**A library for secure smart contract development.** Build on a solid foundation of community-vetted code.

 * Implementations of standards like [ERC20](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/erc20) and [ERC721](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/erc721).
 * Flexible [role-based permissioning](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/access-control) scheme.
 * Reusable [Solidity components](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/utilities) to build custom contracts and complex decentralized systems.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This code was build using solidity and [Ethereum framework](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/frameworks/). Keep in mind its only for testing, [Sepoila](https://www.alchemy.com/overviews/sepolia-testnet) is provider for test coins, and [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com) as api provider.

_If you're new to smart contract development, head to [Developing Smart Contracts]([https://docs.openzeppelin.com/learn/developing-smart-contracts](https://moralis.io/how-to-write-a-smart-contract-in-solidity-full-guide/)) to learn about creating a new project and compiling your contracts._

To keep your system secure, you should **always** use the installed code as-is, and neither copy-paste it from online sources nor modify it yourself. The library is designed so that only the contracts and functions you use are deployed, so you don't need to worry about it needlessly increasing gas costs.
